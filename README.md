# News-Data-Retrival-System
This project aims to build a Contextual News Data Retrieval System that fetches news articles from various sources and stores them in a NoSQL database. The system ranks articles based on different criteria such as relevance to the user's query, publication date, relevance score, text matching score, and proximity to the user's location.
